# Test Harness

A Test Harness automates the execution, monitoring, and validation of tests in embedded systems, ensuring correctness, performance, and compliance. It is used for unit testing, hardware-software integration, regression testing, performance benchmarking, protocol validation, fault injection, security analysis, compliance verification, HIL testing, and CI/CD automation.
