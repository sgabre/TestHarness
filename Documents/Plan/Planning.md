# C BenchMark Project

Here are more features you can implement in your C Benchmark Project to evaluate different testing techniques:

## 1. Public and Private Function Testing
- **Public Function**: A simple API function that performs an operation (e.g., computes a checksum).
- **Private Function**: A helper function used internally by the public function.
- **Testing Focus**:
  - Unit test public functions directly.
  - Use **CMock** to mock private functions and test behavior independently.

## 2. Partitioning Testing
- **Partition Testing** involves dividing the input data into **partitions** where the system is expected to behave similarly.
- Implement test cases that cover:
  - **Valid partitions**: Tests that ensure correct handling of valid input values within each partition.
  - **Invalid partitions**: Tests for edge cases and values outside the expected range for each partition.
- **Example**:  
  - For a function that accepts an integer value, you might divide the input into partitions:  
    - `Positive numbers`: 1 to 100  
    - `Negative numbers`: -100 to -1  
    - `Zero`: 0  
    - `Edge cases`: Just outside the range (e.g., 101, -101).
- **Testing Focus**:  
  - Ensure each partition is adequately tested by selecting representative test cases.
  - Minimize the number of tests by covering multiple scenarios within each partition.
  - 

## 3. State Machine Implementation
- A simple **finite state machine (FSM)** with:
  - **States**: `IDLE → PROCESSING → ERROR → DONE → IDLE`
  - **Transitions**: Triggered by external events (e.g., timers, user input).
- **Testing Focus**:
  - Verify correct state transitions.
  - Ensure invalid transitions are handled properly.
  - Test using boundary values (max/min state transitions).

## 4. Boundary Value Testing
- Implement a function with strict boundary conditions:
  - **Example**: Temperature sensor range (`-40°C to 125°C`)
  - Return error for out-of-range inputs.
- **Testing Focus**:
  - Use boundary values: `-41, -40, 0, 125, 126`
  - Check if edge cases return the correct response.

## 5. Performance Benchmarking
- **Execution Time Measurement** (for optimization tests):
  - Use high-resolution timers (e.g., `clock()` for desktop, `DWT_CYCCNT` for ARM).
  - Compare performance of different implementations (e.g., recursive vs. iterative).
- **Memory Usage Analysis**:
  - Track stack/heap allocation.
  - Detect memory leaks using **Valgrind**.

## 6. Error Handling & Fault Injection
- Implement **error codes** or **exception handling** (if using C++).
- Introduce intentional faults (e.g., divide by zero, buffer overflow).
- **Testing Focus**:
  - Test how the system handles unexpected failures.
  - Validate fault recovery mechanisms (e.g., reset state on error).

## 7. Concurrency & Multi-Threading (Optional for RTOS-Based Systems)
- Implement a **producer-consumer queue** using a ring buffer.
- Test **race conditions** and **deadlocks** using stress tests.
- **Testing Focus**:
  - Validate correct data synchronization.
  - Use **mutexes** or **semaphores** to prevent race conditions.

## 8. Code Coverage & Static Analysis
- Integrate **code coverage tools** (e.g., `gcov`, `lcov`, `BullseyeCoverage`).
- Run **static analysis** with **Cppcheck**, **PC-lint**, or **SonarQube**.
- **Testing Focus**:
  - Ensure 100% coverage for unit tests.
  - Identify potential bugs & vulnerabilities before runtime.

## 9. Secure Coding Practices
- Implement **input validation** to prevent buffer overflows.
- Use **constant-time comparison** for security-sensitive operations (HMAC, password checking).
- **Testing Focus**:
  - **Fuzz testing** with invalid/random inputs.
  - **Boundary testing** for buffer limits.
