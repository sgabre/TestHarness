## Static CodeAnalysis

### Scope

The purpose of Static Code Analysis is to detect defects, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues without executing the program. This process ensures adherence to coding standards, improves maintainability, and reduces technical debt by analyzing the source code for patterns of errors, inefficiencies, and security risks.

### Softwares

- SonarQube: A platform for continuous inspection of code quality, detecting issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

### Inputs

- Code sources (repositories, branches)
- Configuration files and static analysis rules

### Delivery

Quality Report: A comprehensive report detailing the findings of the static code analysis, including:
- Detected vulnerabilities
- Code smells
- Maintainability issues
- Security risks
- Performance concerns

### Criterial

- Compliance with defined coding standards
- Maintainability and readability score
- Number of critical, major, and minor issues detected
- Security vulnerabilities identified and resolved
- Performance metrics and optimization recommendations

### Dashboard

Visual representation of the analysis results, including:

Code quality score

Technical debt estimation

Trend analysis over time

Issue categorization (security, maintainability, performance, etc.)

Comparison of code quality across different versions or branches
