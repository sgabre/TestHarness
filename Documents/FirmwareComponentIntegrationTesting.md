## Firmware Component Integration Testing (Draft)

### Scope

The purpose of Component Integration Testing is to verify that software components, after being tested in isolation, work together correctly within the system. This testing occurs after component testing to ensure that components, which may be specified by different groups at different times, integrate seamlessly. Both positive and negative cases are important, as components may make assumptions about data, and negative testing helps uncover issues caused by erroneous or unexpected data.


### Testbench

#### Hardware

- Microcontroller boards or target hardware used for integration testing.
- External peripherals, sensors, or actuators connected for testing.
- Power supply and any necessary debugging tools (e.g., JTAG, SWD).
- Oscilloscope or logic analyzer for monitoring signal behavior.

#### Software

1. **Test Case Development**  
   - Use of Unity framework to write test cases for each component.
   - Development of mock components using CMock to isolate units.
   - Integration test cases that verify interactions between components.
   - Automation scripts to load test cases onto the hardware.
   
2. **Test Execution**  
   - Test execution using Ceedling framework on the embedded system.
   - Execution of the test cases on the actual hardware or simulation environment.
   - Logging results to capture pass/fail status and error details.
   - Use of Valgrind for memory leak detection and performance profiling.

### Test Type

- **Integration Testing**: To verify that individual firmware components interact correctly as a whole.
- **Regression Testing**: To ensure that changes in one part of the firmware do not introduce new defects elsewhere.
- **Performance Testing**: To measure system response time and resource utilization.
- **Boundary Testing**: To verify edge cases for memory, computation, and peripheral handling.

### Inputs

- Firmware source code or binary files to be tested.
- Test cases and test scripts for each integration scenario.
- Documentation on system requirements and specifications.
- Hardware configuration details and target board settings.
- Mocked input data for simulation of external components.

### Delivery

- Test results including pass/fail status, error logs, and any discovered issues.
- Summary report detailing the coverage of the firmware components tested.
- Recommendations for firmware improvements or fixes.
- Final integration testing sign-off, with all identified defects tracked and resolved.
